An online multiplayer FPS Game which I created as a personal project. It is still a work in progress, but it is currently playable with a few bugs. Aside from the basic FPS aspects which I have working, there is a working lobby system, which you can create public and private lobbies, there is a working character customization screen, and there are also currently two playable maps with more to come.

As this is a current project, I plan to add more maps, mechanics, and game modes to the game. I also plan to fix any current bugs.
